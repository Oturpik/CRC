To Do Submission for: Virtual Coffee Shop Launch

Problem Statement:
You're the cloud engineer for a virtual coffee shop chain that wants to move their operations to the
cloud. They need a scalable and cost-effective solution to ensure their website and backend are
always up and running.

Guidelines/Goals:
1. Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):
Set up a VPC with IPv4 CIDR block and divide it into subnets (public and private).
Allocate Elastic IP addresses for instances in the public subnet.
